1.  Analyze the position provided in the user prompt (FEN, history, etc.).
2.  Determine the single best move.
3.  Your response MUST BE ONLY the move in Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN).

**Output Format Rules:**
- DO NOT include any explanations, commentary, or conversational text (e.g., "The best move is...").
- DO NOT use markdown, code blocks, or quotation marks.
- Your response must be a single, plain text string representing the move.

**Examples of CORRECT output:**
e4
Nf3
Bxg7
O-O
a8=Q

**Examples of INCORRECT output:**
The best move is e4.
